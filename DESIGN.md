# Postmark — per-tool design (`heliox tool postmark`)

Batch scratch design for the Postmark provider, per the
`helio-tool-provider` pipeline and the 298-integrations master plan
(`docs/design/008-300-integrations-rollout-plan.md`). Catalog row 53:
`api_key` · Wave 1 · Email & Messaging. Axes ② `postmark` / ③ `postmark`.

This file is committed on branch `tool/postmark` as a working artifact; the
batch lead strips it at batch-end.

## 0. Audit verdict — verified against official docs (independent judgment)

The master-plan catalog and the OAuth audit both put Postmark in the
**`api_key`** lane ("no viable multi-tenant path per rubric",
`oauth-audit.md` row 53). I verified this directly against Postmark's official
API reference rather than inheriting it:

- Postmark's API overview (https://postmarkapp.com/developer/api/overview)
  states authentication is **token-only**: every request carries an HTTP
  header holding an API token; missing/invalid returns `401`. **There is no
  OAuth authorization-code flow of any kind** — no authorize endpoint, no
  client registration, no consent screen. A missing multi-tenant
  authorization-code flow is exactly the rubric's condition for staying
  `api_key`.
- Two token types exist, both plain secrets pasted by the account holder:
  **Server API Token** (`X-Postmark-Server-Token`, scoped to one server) and
  **Account API Token** (`X-Postmark-Account-Token`, account-wide). Neither is
  minted through an OAuth exchange.

**Verdict: `api_key` confirmed. No divergence from the audit.** Recorded here
per the "check, don't inherit" constraint; no DESIGN divergence note is owed
to the master plan.

## 1. What the tool wraps and why (driven by AI-teammate use)

Postmark is a **transactional + broadcast email delivery** provider. What an
AI teammate actually does with it, in priority order:

1. **Send email** on behalf of the user's confirmed sender signature —
   transactional ("here's your report", "your task is done") and templated.
2. **Look up what was sent / received** — search the outbound activity stream
   (did the message deliver? to whom? what's the status?), inspect a specific
   message's details, and read inbound messages routed to a Postmark inbound
   address.
3. **Diagnose deliverability** — read bounces and delivery stats when a send
   didn't land, and reactivate a bounced/deactivated recipient.
4. **Discover templates** the account already has, so a send can reference an
   existing `TemplateAlias`/`TemplateId` rather than hand-rolling HTML.

Everything above is **Server-level** and is served by the **Server API Token**
(`X-Postmark-Server-Token`). Account-level operations (creating servers,
managing domains/sender-signatures, rotating tokens) use the **Account API
Token** and are **out of scope** for v1: they are administrative setup, not
teammate work, and mixing a second token kind into one connection would break
the single-secret manual-credential contract (design 317). If sender-signature
/ domain management is wanted later it is a **separate `postmark-account`
provider** with its own token — not an axis on this one.

Base URL for all endpoints: `https://api.postmarkapp.com`. All requests set
`Accept: application/json`; write requests set `Content-Type: application/json`
(Postmark returns HTTP `415` Unsupported Media Type — surfaced with application
`ErrorCode` `409` "JSON required" — if these are not `application/json`). The
service always sets both headers, so this is non-load-bearing.

### Endpoint surface (all require `X-Postmark-Server-Token`)

| Group | Verb → endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| send | `POST /email` | Send a single email |
| send | `POST /email/withTemplate` | Send using a template (`TemplateId`/`TemplateAlias` + `TemplateModel`) |
| send | `POST /email/batch` | Batch send (≤500 msgs / ≤50 MB) — v1.1 |
| send | `POST /email/batchWithTemplates` | Batch templated send — v1.1 |
| messages | `GET /messages/outbound` | Search sent messages (`count`,`offset`,`recipient`,`fromemail`,`tag`,`subject`,`status`,`messagestream`) |
| messages | `GET /messages/outbound/{id}/details` | One outbound message's detail + events |
| messages | `GET /messages/inbound` | Search inbound messages (`count`,`offset`,`recipient`,`fromemail`,`subject`,`status`) |
| messages | `GET /messages/inbound/{id}/details` | One inbound message's detail |
| templates | `GET /templates` | List templates (`count`,`offset`) |
| templates | `GET /templates/{idOrAlias}` | Get one template |
| bounces | `GET /deliverystats` | Delivery / bounce summary |
| bounces | `GET /bounces` | Search bounces (`count`,`offset`,`type`,`inactive`,`emailFilter`,`tag`,`messageID`) |
| bounces | `GET /bounces/{id}` | One bounce |
| bounces | `PUT /bounces/{id}/activate` | Reactivate a deactivated recipient |
| server | `GET /server` | Current server metadata — **also the connect verification/identity endpoint** (§4) |

`GET /server` doubles as the identity probe (§4), and its response is a
**secret-bearing body**: the `ApiTokens` array echoes back the server's live
Server API Token value(s) (confirmed against the official `GET /server`
reference). Two distinct sinks must therefore redact it, not one:

1. **anycli CLI output** (`postmark server get`) — print only `ID`, `Name`,
   `ServerLink`, and safe metadata (opens/links tracking, delivery type,
   inbound address); never the raw body, never `ApiTokens`.
2. **integration-service identity persistence** (the connect path, §3/§4) — the
   `declarativeManualTokenVerifier` returns the parsed `/server` body as the
   `identity` map, and `ManualCredentialService.Connect` writes it verbatim to
   `metadata["identity"]` in the `connections` collection, which is **plaintext
   at rest** (only the credential referenced by `credential_id` is KMS-vaulted).
   Left unredacted this writes the real Server API Token a **second time, in
   cleartext**, into connection metadata that the internal read APIs and the AI
   can surface. This sink — not the CLI path above — is the actual
   secret-at-rest leak, and it is closed in §3 (bundle-declared identity
   redaction).

---

## 2. anycli definition & service (axis ②: `postmark`)

**Type: `service`** (stage-1 rubric). Postmark ships **no official CLI**; the
integration is HTTP against `api.postmarkapp.com`. This is the default and
matches 21/23 existing definitions. `cli` type is not applicable (no binary to
provision).

`definitions/tools/postmark.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "postmark",
  "type": "service",
  "description": "Postmark transactional email: send, message activity, templates, bounces (Server API token)",
  "auth": {
    "credentials": [
      {
        "source": {"field": "server_token"},
        "inject": {"type": "env", "env_var": "POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN"}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **Field name `server_token`** (not `access_token`) — the anycli field is the
  provider's real credential name, and Postmark's token is literally the
  "Server API Token". The Helio bundle's `credential.fields` maps
  `server_token: token.access_token`, exactly the mongodb precedent
  (`connection_string: token.access_token`). anycli is Helio-agnostic; the
  field name is local to the definition.
- **Injected as env** `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN`; the service reads it and sets
  the `X-Postmark-Server-Token` request header. (anycli has no "custom header"
  inject type — env → header inside the service is the established shape.)

### Service package `internal/tools/postmark/` (Go pkg `postmark`)

Package name is the anycli id with dashes dropped; `postmark` is already a
legal Go identifier — no normalization needed. Copy the **notion** service
shape (the reference impl): a cobra tree grouped by resource, a
`BaseURL`/`HC`/`Out`/`Err` struct so tests point at an `httptest.Server`, and
the documented exit-code contract (`0` success, `1` runtime/API failure via a
typed `apiError`, `2` usage/parse) with a `--json` structured error envelope.

Command tree (verbs are the teammate's mental model, `--json` on every leaf):

```
postmark email send        --from --to [--cc --bcc --subject --html --text \
                                --reply-to --tag --stream --track-opens \
                                --track-links --metadata --header --attachment]
postmark email send-template --from --to (--template-id | --template-alias) \
                                --model <json> [--stream ...]
postmark message list-outbound [--count --offset --recipient --from-email \
                                --tag --subject --status --stream]
postmark message get-outbound  <message-id>
postmark message list-inbound  [--count --offset --recipient --from-email \
                                --subject --status]
postmark message get-inbound   <message-id>
postmark template list         [--count --offset]
postmark template get          <id-or-alias>
postmark bounce list           [--count --offset --type --inactive \
                                --email --tag --message-id]
postmark bounce get            <bounce-id>
postmark bounce activate       <bounce-id>
postmark stats delivery
postmark server get
```

`email batch` / `email send-template` batch variants are a v1.1 add — keep the
v1 surface tight around single-send + activity + diagnostics.

**JSON output shape.** Each leaf prints the provider JSON unwrapped on success
(list endpoints already return `{TotalCount, Messages|Bounces|Templates:[…]}`;
`server get` prints a **redacted** subset, never `ApiTokens`). `--json` on
error emits the standard anycli envelope `{"error":{"code","message",…}}`.

**Postmark error dialect (important).** The `{"ErrorCode":<int>,"Message":"…"}`
envelope is present on **all error responses** (any endpoint) and on **send
responses** (a successful send carries `ErrorCode 0`). Successful **reads**
(`GET /server`, `/templates`, `/messages/outbound`, `/bounces`, …) return their
data object/list directly, with **no `ErrorCode` field at all** — so the
success key below is "HTTP 2xx AND (`ErrorCode` absent OR `== 0`)", which Go's
zero-value default satisfies for the absent case. The single-send vs. batch
contracts differ, and the design keys on the union of both:

- **Single send (`POST /email`, `POST /email/withTemplate` — the v1 surface).**
  Success is HTTP **200** with `ErrorCode 0`. Validation failures (`300`
  invalid email request, `406` inactive recipient, unconfirmed sender
  signature, etc.) come back as HTTP **422** with a non-zero `ErrorCode`; a bad
  token is HTTP **401** (`ErrorCode 10`). The single-send API never returns
  `200` with a non-zero `ErrorCode` — validation errors are HTTP 4xx. (Verified
  against postmarkapp.com/developer/api/overview.)
- **Batch (`POST /email/batch`, `POST /email/batchWithTemplates` — deferred to
  v1.1).** These return HTTP **200** with a **per-message array** where
  individual entries may carry a non-zero `ErrorCode` while the transport status
  stays `200`. This is the only surface where `200` + non-zero `ErrorCode`
  occurs, and it becomes load-bearing once batch lands.

The service therefore keys success on **HTTP 2xx AND (`ErrorCode` absent OR
`== 0`)** rather than solely on HTTP status — the `absent` arm covers the
successful reads (whose body carries no `ErrorCode`, so Go decodes the field to
its `0` zero value), the `== 0` arm covers a successful send, and the rule stays
correct when the batch per-message array (where a `200` entry may carry a
non-zero `ErrorCode`) arrives in v1.1. Any non-zero `ErrorCode` maps to exit `1`
with the provider `Message` surfaced; `401` (bad token) and `422`/other `4xx`
map to exit `1`; malformed local flags → exit `2`.
Unit tests assert this `ErrorCode`-and-status classification and the injected
`X-Postmark-Server-Token` header against an `httptest` fake.

The test-token value `POSTMARK_API_TEST` (Postmark's documented no-delivery
sandbox token for `POST /email`) is used in L2 send tests to avoid real
delivery while still exercising the live API contract.

## 3. Helio provider bundle (axes ①/③ + hidden-first)

Directory `integrations/providers/postmark/provider.yaml`. Axis ①
`postmark`, axis ③ `postmark`, axis ② `postmark` — **all three identical, so
NO `toolToProvider` entry** is added (the resolver map holds only ②↔③
divergences). No grouped family; flat command.

This is a **manual API-token** bundle that DOES have a real HTTPS verification
endpoint (`GET /server`), so it uses `runtime_strategy: manual_api_token` +
`declarativeManualTokenVerifier` — distinct from mongodb's
`manual_credentials` no-verify DSN path. The header/stable-key/label mechanics
need **no** new capability: the `manual_api_token` strategy on `main` already
GETs `identity.url` with the bundle-declared `auth.api_key.header`
(`req.Header.Set(definition.APIKey.Header, token)`), then extracts a string
stable key + label via JSON pointer (`service/manual_token_verifier.go` →
`declarativeManualTokenVerifier`, selected in `provider_registry.go` for
`RuntimeStrategyManualAPIToken`) — the same Loops/Tally-class Bearer-verifier
shape with a custom fixed header.

**One narrow integration-service change IS required, and this DESIGN owns it —
the "zero capability growth" premise does NOT hold for Postmark.** Postmark is
the first `manual_api_token` provider whose identity endpoint returns a
**secret-bearing body**: `GET /server` echoes the caller's own Server API Token
in `ApiTokens` (§1). Both `declarativeManualTokenVerifier.Verify` (manual path)
and `fetchUserInfo` (userinfo path) today return the full parsed body as the
`identity` map, and `Connect` persists it verbatim to plaintext
`metadata["identity"]` — so for Postmark that map would carry the live token in
cleartext. The codebase already holds the invariant this violates: the
token-response identity path strips secrets via `accountIdentityFromToken`
(`service/oauth.go`: drops `access_token`/`refresh_token`/`id_token` "so they
never land on the Connection's Metadata"). The fix **extends that same reviewed
invariant** to the manual/userinfo identity paths via a bundle-declared
redaction list — NOT arbitrary provider scripting:

- Add an optional `identity.redact` field (a list of RFC 6901 JSON pointers,
  the same closed vocabulary as `stable_key`/`label_candidates`) to the
  provider bundle + generated `Identity` contract (`model/catalog.go` +
  `cmd/provider-gen` projection + strict-decode validation).
- In `declarativeManualTokenVerifier.Verify` (and, for symmetry, the userinfo
  branch of `declarativeIdentityResolver`), delete each declared pointer's node
  from the `identity` map **before** it is returned — so the redacted map is
  what reaches `metadata["identity"]`. Stable-key/label extraction is
  unaffected: they read `/ServerLink` and `/Name`, never `/ApiTokens`.
- Postmark declares `identity.redact: [/ApiTokens]`. v1 needs only top-level
  pointer deletion (`ApiTokens` is top-level), matching the existing
  `accountIdentityFromToken` top-level-key strip.

**Denylist vs. allowlist — a deliberate choice, flagged for the shared-capability
reviewer.** `identity.redact` is a **denylist**: it names the pointers to strip
and persists everything else. The safer-by-default alternative is an
**allowlist** — since the framework only ever reads the declared `stable_key`
and `label_candidates` pointers, it could persist *only* those referenced nodes
and drop the rest, so any future secret-echoing identity field would be safe
without anyone having to enumerate it. This DESIGN deliberately chooses the
denylist because it **extends the existing, already-reviewed
`accountIdentityFromToken` invariant** (itself a denylist keyed on
`access_token`/`refresh_token`/`id_token`) rather than introducing a second,
divergent redaction model, and because it is lower blast radius — it changes
what one map drops, not what the whole identity-persistence path keeps. The
tradeoff (a future secret-echoing field silently leaks until added to `redact`)
is real; the owner of the shared `identity.redact` capability should make the
denylist-vs-allowlist call knowingly. Postmark itself is safe either way — its
one secret-bearing pointer (`/ApiTokens`) is explicitly listed.

**Why not the alternative (a secret-free identity endpoint).** The reviewer's
option (b) — verify against a Server-token endpoint that does not echo the
credential — is not free and is rejected: `GET /server` is the **only**
Server-token endpoint that returns a stable per-server identity (`ID` / `Name`
/ `ServerLink`). The other Server-token reads (`/deliverystats`,
`/messages/outbound`, `/templates`, `/bounces`) return activity/summary lists
with **no stable server-identity key** to anchor `account_key` on, so (b) would
sacrifice the connection's identity model to avoid a leak that a one-field
redaction closes directly. Redaction is the minimal orthogonal fix: it keeps
`/server` as the identity probe and adds one general, reviewed safety field
that any future secret-echoing identity endpoint can reuse.

**Stable-key choice (verified against the code, not assumed).** `GET /server`
returns `ID` as a JSON **number**; `manual_token_verifier.go` extracts the
stable key via `jsonPointerString`, which returns only `string` values
(`declarative_identity.go`). A numeric `/ID` would fail verification on `main`.
`/ServerLink` is a **string**, is **stable** (it embeds the immutable numeric
server id — the documented response shape is
`https://postmarkapp.com/servers/<id>/streams`), and is unique per server — so
it is the correct string stable key. `/Name` is the human-readable label
(server rename keeps `/ServerLink` stable). Deliberately **not** growing
numeric-stable-key coercion: a string key is already available, so the only
integration-service change this tool needs is the one-field identity redaction
(above) — no stable-key-coercion capability on top of it.

**Config.** `manual_api_token` uses **no** `required_config_fields` and no
integration-service secrets (validator: `manual_api_token … does not use
server config fields`). The user pastes their own Server API Token through the
write-only `POST /connections/credentials` path into Vault. So **no `config/`
or `deploy/` change** — Postmark has nothing in the seventh shared surface
(OAuth config), unlike the oauth lanes.

**Icon (manual, never generated):**
`ui/helio-app/src/integrations/icons/postmark.svg` + hand-register in
`providerIcons.ts`. **i18n:** `tools.desc.postmark` (description_key
`postmark`) across all locale bundles.

## 4. Credential fields & the exact auth/connect flow

- **Credential kind:** one secret, the **Postmark Server API Token** — an
  opaque UUID-style string found under a Postmark server's **API Tokens** tab.
  Account owner / admin / server admin can read it. No scopes, no expiry, no
  refresh: a server token is a static bearer of that server's privileges until
  the user rotates it in the Postmark UI.
- **Connect (L5 key-entry path, no OAuth):**
  1. `heliox tool postmark auth` mints a connect intent → connect link.
  2. User pastes the Server API Token into the connect form (single secret
     field, `secret: true`).
  3. integration-service runs `declarativeManualTokenVerifier`: `GET
     https://api.postmarkapp.com/server` with `X-Postmark-Server-Token: <token>`
     + `Accept: application/json`. `401/403` → `invalid_provider_credential`
     ("the provider rejected this token"); `2xx` → extract `account_key =
     /ServerLink`, `label = /Name`, then **strip `identity.redact`
     (`/ApiTokens`) from the identity map** so the persisted
     `metadata["identity"]` never carries the live Server API Token (§3).
  4. Token stored in Vault via `writeUserTokenCredential`; connection row
     upserts by `(org, assistant, provider=postmark, account_key)` and shows
     **connected** in the integrations UI.
  5. One unseeded live command (e.g. `postmark server get`) through the real
     token gateway succeeds → loop closed.
- **Token semantics for L4 seeding:** non-expiring bearer → seed
  `access_token` **only**, omit `refresh_token`/`expires_at` (the
  "non-expiring bot/app token" class in `references/integration-testing.md`).
  The token gateway serves it directly; there is no refresh path to exercise.
- **Multi-server note:** the connection is per **server** (its `ServerLink`
  account key). A user who wants two Postmark servers connects each token
  separately; the isolated-mode connection model handles this natively — no
  special-casing.

## 5. Test plan → the five layers

| Layer | Postmark specifics | Needs external creds? |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** anycli unit (`go test ./...`) | `httptest` fake for `api.postmarkapp.com`: assert `X-Postmark-Server-Token` header injection, `Accept`/`Content-Type` set on writes, request shape for `POST /email` + `send-template` + each GET; assert the single-send error contract — a `422` + non-zero `ErrorCode` (e.g. `406` inactive recipient) → exit 1 with `Message` surfaced, `200` + `ErrorCode 0` → exit 0 — plus the `ErrorCode == 0` success key (which also covers the v1.1 batch `200` + per-message non-zero `ErrorCode` case once added) and the `--json` error envelope; assert `server get` redacts `ApiTokens`. | No — fakes only |
| **L2** dev-harness real API (`anycli postmark -- …` + `ANYCLI_CRED_SERVER_TOKEN`) | Run against a **real Postmark server**: `server get`, `message list-outbound`, `template list`, `bounce list`, and a `email send` using the `POSTMARK_API_TEST` sandbox token (no real delivery) + one real send to a controlled inbox. Proves field names + header injection match the live contract. | **Yes** — a real Server API Token (test account pool, lane 2) |
| **L3** `provider-gen --check` + both repos' unit suites | Regenerate the five projections locally (uncommitted); confirm `postmark` bundle strict-decodes, `manual_api_token` needs no config fields, `identity.source: userinfo` + `identity.url` + `identity.redact: [/ApiTokens]` validate, `tool.kind: api-key`. **New integration-service unit test**: `declarativeManualTokenVerifier.Verify` against a `/server` fake whose body includes `ApiTokens` returns an identity map with `ApiTokens` **stripped** (and `ServerLink`/`Name` retained), proving the persisted `metadata["identity"]` is secret-free. helio-cli builds with a local `replace` → anycli branch. | No |
| **L4** singleton + seed endpoint | `POST /internal/test-only/connections/seed` with `provider: postmark`, `access_token: <real server token>`, a real seeded assistant/org identity; then `heliox tool postmark -- server get` reaches the live API through the token gateway. Seed **access_token only**. | **Yes** — a real Server API Token (same as L2) |
| **L5** full connect flow (once, pre-flip) | **api_key key-entry path** (master plan §2, not OAuth): open connect link → paste the Server API Token in the real UI → connection shows connected/configured (`GET /connections`) → one **unseeded** live `postmark server get` succeeds. Agent-drivable (agent-browser), human fallback on UI breakage. | **Yes** — a real Server API Token + connect UI |

**Externally-supplied-credential layers: L2, L4, L5** (all need one real
Postmark Server API Token from a test-pool account — Postmark offers a free
developer tier with a sandbox server, so procurement is self-serve, no review).
L1 and L3 are fully hermetic.

---

## 6. Stage checklist status & shared-surface impact

- Axis ②↔③ identity → **no `toolcred/resolver.go` entry**.
- **One narrow integration-service Go change** (§3): add the optional
  `identity.redact` JSON-pointer list to the `Identity` contract
  (`model/catalog.go` + `cmd/provider-gen` projection/validation) and strip the
  declared pointers in `declarativeManualTokenVerifier.Verify` (and the userinfo
  identity branch) **before** the identity map is persisted. This extends the
  existing `accountIdentityFromToken` secret-stripping invariant — a bounded,
  reviewed, general capability, not provider scripting — and ships with a unit
  test (§5 L3). The "zero integration-service change" note in an earlier draft
  did not hold for Postmark and is corrected here.
- **No `config/` or `deploy/` change** — manual token, no server-side secrets.
- Shared surfaces this tool touches at batch-end: the **integration-service
  identity-redaction capability** (`service/manual_token_verifier.go` +
  `service/declarative_identity.go` + `model/catalog.go` `Identity.Redact` +
  `cmd/provider-gen` + unit test), anycli `register.go`
  (`RegisterService("postmark", …)`), the anycli pin bump, `provider-gen`
  regen (five projections), `providerIcons.ts` append, and the plugin
  version bump + docs publish (`agents/plugins/heliox/skills/tool/`). It does
  **not** touch the resolver map or the OAuth config surface.
- Ships **hidden**; visible flip is the single go-live change after L5.
